There aren't all that many books (that I know of) set in Victorian-era India, so already this book is pretty fascinating. But the cast of characters are all very compelling and interesting, and most of them sympathetic in their own way. Some really great parallel plot lines and, although they're fairly sparse, some plain hilarious moments. I can't wait to start River of Smoke!
