Quite amazing. I thought it would actually be kind of dry (wasn't too impressed by the movie) but was pleasantly surprised by the degree to which Ishiguro completely inhabits and explicates the perspective of this unreliable narrator.  It was at times funny, sad, and so-very-chilling.  What starts out as a sort of charming look at someone caught in the turbulence of changing mores and post-war realities quickly becomes a haunting portrait of single-mindedness that morphs into thoughtlessness and even viciousness.



I rather liked the dual competing themes: the role of the butler as a commentary of British global aspirations, and the problem of being a professional in a domestic environment vis-a-vis raw romantic angst.  They were very well interwoven and they complement each other nicely.



One final note, I'm glad I've seen a few episodes of Downton Abbey before having read this book.  It's very useful background research!
