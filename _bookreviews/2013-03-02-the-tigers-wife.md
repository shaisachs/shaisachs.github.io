Getting in to this book was a little challenging: at first it felt a bit like so many unrelated vignettes that were trying to be a novel.  And I think the way that it was set in a sort of anonymized post-Bosnian landscape was a little disorienting, too.  That being said, once I got into it, I really enjoyed it, despite not fully understanding it.  There are four pillars of the book, as it were: the theme of domestication and the constant references to the Jungle Book (which I've not read); the story of the deathless man; the role of medicine in war; and the actual story of the tiger's wife.  I've yet to really figure out how they all fit together, but they make for a fascinating puzzle!
