A very practical, useful take on some of the day-to-day issues that women in the professional world face as they try to advance in their careers. I think Sandberg does a very good job of being fair to women regardless of their career choices, and her attitude is very reasonable: she wants women who choose to pursue a career, to be able to do so, and to be able to have the opportunity to go as far as they want in their career. Really, what she's arguing for is just basic, common-sense fairness in the workplace. Her nuts-and-bolts suggestions (like across-the-board mentoring programs; "lunch-only" policies that prevent good-old-boy networks from forming; and even pregnancy parking spaces) are very reasonable; I'd like to see these measures adopted in more workplaces.
