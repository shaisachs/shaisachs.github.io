Ugh! As a page turner it's quite good-though even in that regard, the action picks up much more slowly than in the Da Vinci Code. Otherwise it's just so very simplistic and sloppy. The main theme of the book, the conflict between religion and science, is treated without any kind of sophistication or intelligence whatsoever. Sure the characters are interesting and the plot is gripping, but this theme, with its complex and many-faceted history, deserves much better than the one-dimensional superficial look it got here.
