I had a great time reading this book-it's very gripping and enjoyable. I had the impression, somehow, that it was an anti-religious book; and while it is highly critical of established religion, it's actually very spiritual, which was surprising to me. The concept of daemons is fascinating and well-drawn, with some excellent exposition as the story progresses. The last third or so was a little sloppy though, and I got the impression that he was hurrying through it. Particularly amusing is the idea that the plot turns on a fire drill-that seemed like quite an odd device to me. Still, a wonderful book, and highly recommended!
