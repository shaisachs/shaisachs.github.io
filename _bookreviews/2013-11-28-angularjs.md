A good overview, but I would have appreciated a little bit of a more "backstage" view of Angular - i.e., how it all works behind the scenes.  I find that is often most helpful in figuring out why the framework doesn't work the way I think it should.



I should also add that the book sort of fell apart around chapter 7 - I found that chapter a bit more disorganized and less-helpful than the rest of the book.  The sidebar on $scope.apply was almost comically unclear, despite its pretense of clarifying a question which I hadn't even had until that point in the book.



All the same - this book is a very good introduction to the framework.  It could certainly use a more detailed companion, though.
