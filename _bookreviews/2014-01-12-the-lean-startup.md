A fascinating read about an idea which, as nearly as I can tell, is the business theory equivalent of agile development in the world of software programming.  I found the ideas around validated learning and minimum viable products to be very useful and illuminating as far as my own work goes.  On the other hand the section on the Five Whys was all a bit hand-wavey and not sufficiently clear - in particular because it seems like an idea which requires a fair amount of elaboration around the margins. (For example, what if it's not entirely clear why a particular problem occurred?)



As a bonus, I appreciated the historical context around scientific management in the epilogue.
