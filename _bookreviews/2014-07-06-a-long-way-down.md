Quite a hilarious book, especially considering that it's about four people who want to kill themselves.  And yet... there's very little room for this book to go anywhere but down.  These characters are compelling in their own way, but nothing really happens - not in the way of activity nor of growth, really.  A great deal of time and bother separates the first page from the last page, but by the end, not a whole lot has really changed.  Of course I was not expecting any sort of fairy tale ending, that would have been simply gag-worthy, but I was looking for... perhaps some kind of interesting twist, and there was none to be found.  Maureen grows a bit, to be sure, Martin has an interesting conversation with his ex, JJ has a very mildly profound revelation about himself, and Jess.. doesn't seem to do much of anything.  I guess I'm not very taken by character-driven stories in any case, I prefer some sort of interesting message, and this book seems to lack even that.  So, not a terrible read exactly, but I think I could have found something more worthwhile.
