I enjoyed this book, I think, more than most Game of Thrones fans. While I sort of understand what all the carping is about, I like the fact that Martin was trying to do something new in this book, by exploring new scenery and new characters. That's a risky move in some ways - sticking to the tried and true is a sure way to please fans - but what's good writing without some risks?



I'm enjoying this whole what-is-dead-can-never-die thing. It seems like nearly every possible thing in this book is about something dead rising up again - between the various followers of the Drowned Gods, the Hound, Renly in various ways, the Others, and of course everyone's favorite leader of a band of outlaws. Martin must be well nigh obsessed with zombies.



I'm also going to be a bit of a contrarian and say I'm beginning to like Cersei a bit more. She's more clever than she gets credit for, she does have some things she cares about, and she's doing the best she can in a world that is not really well-suited to her. Sure she screwed over the Starks in all but the most literal of ways - but compare her to Catelyn for a minute. Can we really say that the one is so much better than the other, in the final analysis?



Despite the fact that I enjoyed this book more than most people seemed to - I'm definitely looking forward to book 5!
