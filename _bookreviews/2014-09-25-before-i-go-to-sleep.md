This book was a fun, quick read, but otherwise fairly underwhelming.  There's a twist ending which, I thought, was fairly predictable.  The characters are not on the whole compelling, and I have some real questions about Dr. Nash - he seems like a rather shady character whose behavior doesn't really get any serious scrutiny.  (Although yes, obviously, he helps Christine a great deal, etc.)  I thought the theme of memory and humanity was vaguely interesting - like, is it our memory which in fact makes us human, after all, and what would we do without it, etc.  But even that concept wasn't all that compelling.
