I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this book, since I don't, as a general rule, appreciate crime novels all that much.  But this story is much more than that - it's one part psycho-thriller, another part historical fiction, and it's got a dash of supernatural feminism thrown in for good measure.  The images are wonderful, and I was particularly enamored of the clever symbolic use of cloth and needlework.  The cast of characters was a bit overwhelming at first, and the epistolary format did not help in that regard, but it all came right after a hundred pages or os.  It's a terrific work all around, and a great way to learn a few things about Canadian history and the history of care for the mentally ill, in the bargain.  I must say, having read The Handmaid's Tale and giving some serious thought to reading the MaddAddam series, that I'm roundly impressed by Atwood's versatility and sheer narrative power, it's quite impressive.
