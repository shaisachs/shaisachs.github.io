A pretty handy look at the Heroku ecosystem, its history and jargon.  As someone who's had a modicum of experience with Heroku over the past year or two, and who has a reasonably decent grasp on the basics of relational database administration, most of the text was filling in background rather than introducing entirely new concepts.  That said, the chapter on custom buildpacks was really interesting and, I suspect, will one day be a really useful reference.  If you've not worked with Heroku and need to worry about deployment processes and production environments with any moderate amount of frequency, this quick hundred-page read (which took me something like a month to actually finish...) is definitely worth it.
