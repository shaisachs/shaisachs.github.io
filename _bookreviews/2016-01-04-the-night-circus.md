The Night Circus focuses on a contest between two magicians, performed in the context of a mysterious circus and lasting for many, many years.  The circus, a fantasy world of tents and performances and delicious food that opens at dusk and closes at dawn, quickly accumulates a crowd of characters - performers and patrons - who become caught up in the contest, without knowing the first thing about it.



It's an absolute delight to sink into this world and to read Morgenstern's descriptions, which are luxurious and yet stop just short of excessive detail.  I had a lovely time imagining this fascinating world of mysterious sights and impossible sensations.  I wanted more than anything to be able to see the clock at the heart of the circus, to see the bonfire lit at midnight, or to have been invited to one of the fascinating dinners held at the proprietor's house.  I very much appreciated the opposing themes of learning and inheritance, made concrete through the imagery of ink and blood.  It was an exceptionally clever and well-executed device, and these themes blended together in just the right way.



If there is a shortcoming to this book, it's the way in which it leaves so much left unwritten, and so much space for interpretation and filling in the blanks.  How, exactly, Celia becomes such an integral part of the circus; what the rules of the magical contest are; and what, exactly, causes Prospero and Alexander to be such bitter rivals - all of these questions remain unanswered, and that is a little frustrating.  But I'm fairly certain the frustration is perhaps the point.  The best way to read this book, I think, is not to worry about the uncertainty, and to just enjoy the fantasy world that is built on top of it.



I had a great time reading this book, and I highly recommend it.  It's well worth paying attention to the dates and places at the beginning of each chapter - it gets interesting - and to keeping track of the Shakespeare references and maybe read up a little bit on tarot cards.  This book rewards careful reading, even though it doesn't require it.
