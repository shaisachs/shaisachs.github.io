This book explores the interconnected stories of four characters living in modern-day London. The storylines center around Sir Howard Pink, an eccentric billionaire whose daughter went missing years ago. There is also Esme Reade, a mid-career journalist struggling to keep her head above water in a rapidly-changing industry; Beatrice Kizza, a refugee from Ugana trying to find a place in her new country; and Carol Hetherington, a widow trying to cope with the recent loss of her husband.



I enjoyed this book a good deal. The prose is vibrant and tactile, with every scene expertly rendered. The plot has a few twists and turns here and there, but nothing so extraordinarily shocking. The characters are interesting and relatable, flawed in their own ways - Sir Howard most of all. I did find the storyline around Carol to plod on a bit, but I think the other storylines made up for it nicely. I especially appreciated the contrast between Sir Howard's storyline and Beatrice's. The theme of loss and recovery was explored in a handful of interesting (if not exactly cunningly incisive) ways. Perhaps my major misgiving is just that the ending is just a bit too neat and triumphant.



I don't know that I came away from this book with a new appreciation for the human condition, or anything so profound as that. But it was an enjoyable read.
