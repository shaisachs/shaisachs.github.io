The Guest Room is the story of a bachelor party gone horribly awry, told from alternating points of view. One of these is the unfortunate host of the party, a well-to-do middle-aged guy whose brother, the bachelor in question, has some decidedly shady friends. The other is one of the strippers at the party, the unwitting accomplice to a spur-of-the-moment murder. It's a fairly gripping story, with some interesting twists and turns and a good deal of sympathy for the plight of sex trafficking victims everywhere. It's a bit melodramatic here and there, and the tone is just a bit more breathless than I really like, but it's on the whole a well-told story.
