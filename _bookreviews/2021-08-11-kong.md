This book is a reasonably good introduction to Kong, especially its APIs and the various extensibility options it provides. The language is rather awkward, with some particularly drawn-out and convoluted metaphors that often get in the way of the text. There's also some unusual and in some cases plainly misleading commentary on the larger microservices ecosystem surrounding Kong - that could have been excised altogether. As far as I can tell, there are actually no other books providing Kong introductions, so this one will have to do... but it's surely possible to improve upon it!
