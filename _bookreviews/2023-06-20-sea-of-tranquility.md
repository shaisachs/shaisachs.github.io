Sea of Tranquility is a wonderfully intricate novel with numerous interconnected storyline, separated by decades. There's the girl living on a moon colony; an aristocratic "remittance man" bumbling around the wilds of Victoria Island; and something about a time traveler. The prose is really lovely and untangling the puzzle of it all is a certain kind of joy. That said, the "point" of the book came out to be a little strange and in some way uninteresting. The time travel elements did not help, either. Still I enjoyed the way this book fit into the larger "Mandel-verse," at least as I understand it fits into Station Eleven and some others. On the whole I'm glad I read it, but I really would have liked a different resolution to the central conundrum of the story.
