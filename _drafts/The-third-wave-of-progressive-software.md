title: The third wave of progressive software
---



The first wave of progressive software was characterized by companies like NGP Software, VAN, ActBlue, and Blue State Digital. These companies made modern database-backed web applications available to Democratic campaigns, committees, PACs, and other affiliated groups, with each company staking out the high ground in one functional area or another: NGP Software in campaign finance compliance, VAN in field organizing, and so forth. By and large the 2004 election cycle was a watershed moment for each of these companies, with Howard Dean's campaign a particular focal point of activity for many of the principals.

The second wave of progressive software was characterized by the rise of data analytics firms, especially Blue Labs and Civis. These firms made it easy for progressive clients to readily target voters, volunteers, and other constituents along a variety of different characteristics. Once again a presidential election cycle proved pivotal in the formation of this wave; the Obama campaign's keen focus on data analytics was the proving ground for many of the techniques that these firms would go on to commercialize.

The third wave of progressive software is the one we are experiencing today. We are now seeing a flurry of activity in developing new apps for use by progressives. While it's a little early yet to predict which firms will emerge as the incumbents from this wave, there are a few fascinating trends taking shape:

1. The bulk of activity seems to be focused on engaging progressive activists, and capturing the enthusiasm of people shocked by some of the worst excesses of the Trump administration. In particular we are seeing quite a few apps which help progressives contact their elected officials, or which make it easy to find rallies and other events where they can get involved in resistance activities.
2. There seems to be tremendous interest in open source software development. Although not all third-wave apps are open source - and indeed, some of the most successful apps are not - the idea that progressive software should be open source seems to have tremendous appeal among third-wave software developers. Of particular note here is the activity of Progressive Coders Network, which is a community of software developers producing software apps of one flavor or another. The network is dedicated to open source principles, and many of the apps in the Progressive Coders umbrella are open source. I'll probably return to this trend in a later blog post, since it seems to me that the actual definition of open source principles, as applied to progressive softwarem is a bit of a conversation these days.
3. The volunteer vs. the entrepreneur. There is a bit of a tension in this movement, because some of the apps in the third wave are being built by a community of volunteers, while others are built by entrepreneurs. To be sure the line between the volunteer and the entrepreneur is somewhat gray; but the separator seems to be the enunciation of a clear business plan among apps built by entrepreneurs on the one hand, and the tendency to give relatively little thought to a business plan, among apps built by volunteers. This tension is certainly related to the popularity of open source software; most volunteer apps are open source, and most private apps are closed source - although there are certainly exceptions to that rule.
4. The decline of partisanship. Here again the trend is a bit blurry; there are certainly many third-wave apps which will work only with Democratic or progressive clients. But there's also a distinct number of projects which are either explicitly bipartisan, or ambiguous about their partisan identification. By and large this trend appears to be a byproduct of volunteer software development, since partisanship generally requires the formation of a for-profit entity. But there certainly may be other contributing factors.
