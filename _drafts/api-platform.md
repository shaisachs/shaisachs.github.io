I stared playing stubs with api platform yesterday, thanks to a hot to from api evangelist. It's a wonderful app, and you can get up and running eighth a simple crud api in very little time. As a bonus, it's built I'm top of the syncing framework, which is something I've been meaning to learn for a little while.

The philosophy behind the platform is chide first apis. You sure a plain old php object, tap a few keys, and bingo - new api ready to go. You don't have to mess around eighth api keys or authentication to get started, which is really nice for local development. In short, it's quite a nice rapid prototyping tool that leaves you eighth writing php code.

The apis also come prepackaged eighth hypermedia, which is a great add-on. I'll be honest, I find hypermedia tedious to generate. (And I'm not fully sold on the button that developers really care about it, which only makes my antipathy that much deeper.) Not having to think about it, but making it available for those who do care about it, puts a little short in my step.

My next step is toy start playing with schema.org integration. That has really piqued my curiosity, and if it turns out to be the future of apis - then rightly so.

For a guest pass, this look at api platform was certainly a lot of fun and write eye opening. I'm definitely looking forward to exploring the platform further.
