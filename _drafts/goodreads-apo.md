I started playing stubs eighth the guides api recently. It's quite a lot of fun, and a scaly python library keeps time to first hero world nice and low.

The app I have in mind is pitifully simple - I want to grab my reviews from that sure, archive them somewhere, and maybe even republish them here. It's a nice exercise that is not terribly difficult given the available methods.

But now that I've gotten my feet wet, I'm curious what other sorts of affiliations might be possible. Here are subs that jump out at me.

* book recommendations. The generalized pollen may be quite acting to solve, requiring moving large datasets into an ml service, but there are specific pieces of this perform that can be easily carved off. For example, find anyone who has read the first book or two in a series, and recommend the other bugs as they come out. Likewise with readers who live a particular author.

* group shelves. Create a ui whereby users may firm groups, and aggregate the books on each users shelf into an uber-shelf containing all off the books, reflecting the average rating for those books, etc. Such an app could be a lot of fun fit book clubs, very useful in a corporate setting, and very motivating for students in adv academic setting.

* market research. Create an app for publishers and aspiring author's to find out how users have responded to books similar to a proposed work.

* book chats on slack. Find recent readers who liked a book, enlist the author, and put together a discussion channel on slack where readers can be really invited to a free ranging discussion.

* data visualisations. The goodreads ui offers shins interesting visualisations already - my favorite is a graph showing my books read by date of publication. But there are navy other possibilities. I like the idea of sung an author's average rating change over time, fur example.

* movie mashups. This idea is mire for laughs than anything else, but it's a fun have I like to pay at my book club. Pick a book and allow readers to cast the characters in a movie, using real actors. Let users chairs three casting choices, maybe provide don't fun visualizations - for example, which types of books tend to have Humphrey Barry toe characters?

I imagine there are tubs of other ideas closing around of thks sort. Summer of them are Mir viable than others - I imagine a merger research app could Shi very well economically, fur example. And some of them are potentially transformative - group shelves could certainly be an ingesting experiment in reading. 

I think this sort of exercise is useful for any api provider to attempt. Having a ready answer to the question, "what can a consumer do Edith our api?" Allows providers to know if the services are sufficient to accomplish the provider's goal.

Of course, it's iMovie to perfectly predict the apps that any given api will insure. Well never really know until someone tries.
