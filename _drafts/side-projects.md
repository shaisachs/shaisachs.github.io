I'm a big fan of side protects. However, I think that, like most developers, my enthusiasm for them is much more theoretical than practical. For every side project ever pursued, there are probably a dozen or more which aree written down in a notebook somewhere and lost to the sands of time.

There's nothing wrong with generating a bunch of ideas that never see the light of day. It's fun, and a good way to exercise tge creative muscle. Sometimes a side project idea will even come back to me as a plausible solution, or inspiration for a solution, to a real problem I have at work. On the rare occasions when I'm so inclined, actually implementing an idea is a good way to learn something new.

But what if it was possible to do something more with all these hair brained ideas? What if it was possible to get them to a point where they're more than just cheap talk, without actually having to dedicate entire weekends to making them come alive?

It occurs to me that it actually is possible for side projects to see the light of day - cheaply, without the need to do anything as crazy as for-reals implementation.

My plan is to take my side project ideas and to sketch out working apis for them. The result will be back-end services that would, if paired with a proper UI, actually result in an interesting app that real users could play with, and which might actually be valuable.

The hope is that I'll learn a thing or two about API design along the way, and maybe that I'll get to play with a few rapid prototyping frameworks as well. I'm curious to see, too, how much variety there will be in the underlying designs. Is it going to be CRUD all the way down, or do certain kinds of projects tend to require very different sorts of interfaces? Can I get away with purely RESTful designs, our will GraphQL or Falcor prove a more proper fit in some cases? How much - or how little - will UI concerns like push notifications sneak in to the design?

It's bound to be an interesting journey, one way or the other. Tune in here for more!
