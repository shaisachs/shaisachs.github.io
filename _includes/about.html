        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p class="lead">I'm a software developer who loves progressive politics and wonderful prose.</p>
        
        <p>During the day I work as the Innovation Platform Director at <a href="http://ngpvan.com">NGP VAN</a>, which means I manage <a href="http://developers.ngpvan.com">our APIs</a> and help progressive causes of every stripe innovate and engage their supporters. I’ve spent decades as a progressive activist, and about the same time as a software developer. I started out with C, dabbled in Java, spent a little too long with PHP and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/shaisachs">Drupal</a>, had some laughs with NodeJS, but seem to be hanging around .NET more and more these days.</p>
        
        <p>I love reading, especially literary fiction, and have been doing my best to write a review of every single book I’ve read since 2013. Since I believe turnaround is fair play, I’ve dabbled in some writing projects of my own, and might one day share them. In my spare time I help organize a fun and fascinating <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Book-Club-for-Heartbreaking-Geniuses-and-Those-Who-Love-Them/events/229404910/">book club</a>.</p>
