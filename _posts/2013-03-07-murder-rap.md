For what it was - which was a every detailed look at these two murders from a police investigator's point of view - this book was pretty fun and reasonably well-paced. I was hoping for something with a slightly more bird's-eye view - like a bit more context on the history of violence in rap and the way it shaped hip-hop, that sort of thing - so it wasn't quite what I was looking for. But if you're interested in the various characters occupying the world of rap in the late 90s, it's well worth it!
