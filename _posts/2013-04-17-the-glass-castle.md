Quite gripping! And fairly disturbing. We start with a portrait of a hard-scrabble family that seems like it's basically loving if a touch dysfunctional. But over the course of the book we discover that what looked like parental absent-mindedness is really troubling neglect and selfishness. All that said, the sheer determination and ingenuity of the narrator and her siblings is stunning. I wish she had given more attention to the various turning points in her relationship with her parents - there's not a whole lot of explication of why she chose to change her relationship over time as she did - but I suppose that's asking quite a lot. On the whole, quite well done, and definitely recommended for anyone who likes the "life could be a lot worse"-type narratives.
