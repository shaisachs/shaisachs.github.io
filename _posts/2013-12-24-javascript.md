What do you say about a programming book whose every chapter begins with a quote from William Shakespeare? Clearly this book was written by someone who has thought a lot about the language, and whose conclusions generally make a lot of sense. Crockford's writing is clear, clean, and illuminative, and I learned more than a few important tips. More than that, I gained a much better appreciation and understanding of some fundamental Javascript concepts, especially prototypical inheritance. My one misgiving is that he seems to really enjoy mucking around with the fundamentals of types, via Function.prototype, Array.prototype, and the like - which I suspect would turn out to be a lot more confusing than practical in many cases.
