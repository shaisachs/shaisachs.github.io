A handy and quick read (I started and finished it on the flight between Boston and DC) that is a good bird's-eye view of online organizing heading into the 2014 elections. Most of what I read in here I had already had at least a glancing familiarity with, whether through work or because I'd seen it in passing in Gmail or Facebook. The audience seems to be campaign staff who know enough about "old-world" fundraising, organizing, and communications, but who could use a helping hand into the online world.



I think (hope!) what's next is an "online organizing 201" type of handbook, that is more focused on online organizers who have some experience but are looking to find the next big thing. Every year there are dozens of interesting experiments in online organizing, and I think we could certainly use a summary of some of the most important experiments - what worked, what didn't, why, etc.



But there's no question that this book is a great primer, and well worth reading for anyone who wants to get the lay of the land in online organizing.
