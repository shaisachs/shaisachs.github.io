I read this book in large part because it was a free gift at a conference, and I was a bit bored on the plane ride home. You get what you pay for, it seems, because the book is rather shallow, and in parts fairly nasty and mean-spirited. What's worse, the "knowledge" in here is drawn largely from Ramsey's rather narrow field of experience; the book doesn't seem to allow for any suggestion that there are other viewpoints or experiences which might be worthwhile. All that said: I suppose it's a reasonably interesting look at life as a CEO, and Ramsey does go into some detail on the anatomy of sales, marketing, finances, and other areas which I have little-to-no experience with, so it was somewhat interesting from that point of view. The one reasonably decent idea I picked up is that it's a good idea to start your day with making a prioritized todo list, so that you can return to it after getting interrupted.
