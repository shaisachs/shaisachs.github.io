This book has an interesting perspective on modern parenting. It attempts to reframe modern parenting dilemmas in light of traditional Jewish teachings on moderation, sanctification, and celebration. The focus is squarely on the problems of upper-middle class families raising elementary school children, and the book takes aim at the practice of helicopter parenting again and again.



As a parenting book, it's more philosophical than practical. I've certainly read books that are more hands-on, with step-by-step instructions on how to solve a fairly narrow band of problems. This book focuses on better ways to think about a broad class of parenting problems, and doesn't concern itself too much with the details of implementation.



The book felt a bit too religious for my tastes, and it seemed to assume a very particular set of Jewish values that felt kind of odd to me as well. One could just as well pick a different set of Jewish values around which to center a parenting philosophy - such as learning, hope, and social justice. Those values seem to me far more central to Jewish thought and life than the ones the author chose, and more relevant to parenting as well. But then again, I'm hardly an expert.



In any case, it's a reasonably interesting book. I'm not sure it gave me a whole lot of interesting insights, but perhaps more religiously inclined readers would find more value in it.
