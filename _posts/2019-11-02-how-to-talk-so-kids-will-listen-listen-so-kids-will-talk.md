This book is rather wildly popular among parents who are looking for a better way to discipline their children. The approach here is very humane and gentle, with a focus on maintaining and building upon the parent-child relationship. It seems to be of a piece with other approaches that emphasize emotional intelligence and brain development, like No Drama Discipline. It picks up where that book left off by providing practical advice and encouraging parents to coach themselves on different situations before they occur. It's not by any means a foolproof approach - like any other parenting system, it's going to fall short in some circumstances. And it requires a lot of self-discipline and practice on the part of parents. But when it works it feels great. On the whole I'm very glad I read this book, and I think it's a very helpful guide for any parent.
