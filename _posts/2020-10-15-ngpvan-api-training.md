Last week I put together a training on use of the [NGP VAN API](https://developers.ngpvan.com/) for the [Ragtag](https://ragtag.org/) community. Definitely relived some old memories, since the demo was more or less a recitation of my standard API training litany back when I worked at NGP VAN. Max Kamin-Cross from EveryAction kicked off the training with some background on VAN, and Shauna Gordon-McKeon from Ragtag organized the training and also provided further training on [Parsons](https://github.com/move-coop/parsons). It was a great time!

The session was recorded, so contact me for a link if you missed it. I've also put together a [Postman collection](https://gist.github.com/shaisachs/d6788c4eeb4d5e2e716fa5938b8fa732) including the API calls I made during the training. Enjoy!
