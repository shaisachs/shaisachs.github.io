I've been picking through episodes of [The Great Battlefield](https://greatbattlefield.com/), and have been really enjoying it. It's a podcast hosted by Nathaniel G. Pearlman, which interviews "political entrepreneurs" who are leading the charge to make progressive change. I dimly recall hearing about this podcast when Nathaniel first started it shortly after the 2016 elections, though frankly I was a little too freaked out by the developments in the news to check it out too carefully. (Nathaniel is the "NGP" part of NGP VAN, so I've had a chance to chat with him a few times here and there.) I'm not really sure what prompted me to start listening to it recently, but I'm glad I did! It's a really great tour of the progressive tech space, which touches on some of the biggest industry incumbents as well as some of the exciting new up-and-comers. And it's not a bad source of ideas for future ventures, either - one of Pearlman's recurrent questions is something like "What problems do you think we still need to solve? What sort of gaps are there in the movement?" And so on. Definitely worth a listen for anyone with an interest in the space!
