I've just dried the ink on my latest short story - [The Recipe](https://github.com/shaisachs/the-recipe/blob/master/the-recipe.md).

Which also means I've won National Novel Writing Month, hurray! Give or take 45,000 words here or there, that is. I set my sights somewhat more realistically than the official goal, and aimed for 5,000 words in a month rather than 50,000. No matter, what's a significant digit here or there?

For this story, I set out to explore [Lady Lovelace's Objection](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-test/#LadLovObj), which is a simple and fascinating idea from the early days of computing. The notion that computational "intelligence" is really just a mask for that of the computer program's author seems relatively obvious to me. But it's coming under increasingly sustained criticism as the machine learning industry appears to scale more stunning heights year after year. The consequences are potentially tremendous; taken to its logical conclusion, the idea that computational intelligence is somehow equivalent to human intelligence could wreak havoc on our legal system and the accountability measures we need to keep bad actors at bay. So, my goal was to revive Lady Lovelace's Objection, and the elegant idea behind it.

At the same time, I wanted to explore the epistolary format - it's a form of storytelling which I've always admired but have never quite attempted. And I wanted to have another go at the genre I had tried out two years ago, [techno-magical realism](https://shaisachs.github.io/2018/05/05/the-menu.html). I actually went and wrote a whole appendix explaining my writing process, and the thought behind the story, in some detail - mainly because it seemed the only fair thing to do for the poor reader.

I'm not sure it was my most successful effort ever. Poor old Lady Lovelace's idea got rather bungled up. But I really enjoyed it anyway. If all goes well I'm going to try and brush it up and publish it as a Kindle single, as I did with my previous story. If you have any interest in helping me to review it, I'd certainly appreciate it! In the meantime, I'm happy to step back and enjoy the accomplishment, for the time being.
