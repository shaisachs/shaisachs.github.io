This week I've switched teams at Wayfair - I'm now working on the API Platforms team. Our mission is developer acceleration: helping teams across the entire organization develop robust, snappy APIs. In a sense it's a return to my home turf - I've been fascinated by APIs for as long as I've known they exist, and really enjoy working with them. At the same time I think there's a great deal to learn. I've spent considerable time evangelizing APIs to third parties, and working under the hood of a suite of APIs specific to our Pricing team. But I've yet to really grapple with the difficulties of creating a world-class API ecosystem within a far-flung organization whose functions range from digital ad placement to large-parcel shipping. It's quite an exciting challenge!

Mission number one is a pretty exciting project which aims to empower developers in a whole host of little tasks they encounter day-to-day. It's a great place to start, and I can't wait to see it go live!
