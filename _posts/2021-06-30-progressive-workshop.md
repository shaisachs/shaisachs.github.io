My new site, [Progressive Workshop](https://progressive-workshop.com/), is now live. As [I promised last month](https://shaisachs.com/2021/05/24/progressive-workshop.html), the site houses a variety of resources as well as an idea lab that identifies problems in the world of progressive tech, and offers solutions. At the moment it's very much a hobby project, but I hope to grow it into something more. Maybe someday it'll even inspire someone else to start a new venture!

Thus far I've focused on blog posts that seek to work out the approximate shape and size of the progressive tech industry, and to address some of the biggest issues in the space - funding streams, the pace of innovation, etc. Over time I hope to dig in to more tactical issues: metrics in digital organizing is something I have in my sights these days, for instance. Bringing startup crowdfunding to bear on progressive tech is another. And that's very much the tip of the iceberg.

For the moment I'm pretty excited about the [progressive startup studio](https://progressive-workshop.com/idealab/2021/06/28/progressive-startup-studio.html) concept I described the other day. Though I don't have nearly the expertise to actually pull something like that off, I view it as a vital necessity for the broader movement: it is how we will pick up the pace of innovation and, I hope, bring new business models as well as new tech to the table.

I have long been fascinated in progressive tech - depending on how I count, for twenty years or more. In some ways this new project is really just the next logical step in my journey through this space. I certainly hope it helps others participate and grow this very exciting industry.
