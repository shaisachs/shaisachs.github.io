Yesterday I finalized my new short story, [The Game](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09PH61G4C). It's now available on Kindle! I'll have more to say about it in the next few weeks. For now, it's nice to be done! If you're the kind of person who enjoys trolling through git commit history, you'll see it was [a bit of a race](https://github.com/shaisachs/the-game/commits/main) to get this thing done by end of year.
