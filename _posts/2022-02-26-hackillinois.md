This morning I gave a workshop on APIs at [HackIllinois](https://hackillinois.org/), a hackathon for students and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. It was pretty fun to return to my alma mater (albeit virtually!) and get to hear what kinds of ideas students are kicking around these days. The talk was fairly introductory material, but the students kept me on my toes with questions at the end. The talk is on Youtube now - [check it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knQD2aJHkik)!
