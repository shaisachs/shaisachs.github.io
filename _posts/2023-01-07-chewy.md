This post is fairly late to the game, but better late than never! Last fall I moved from Wayfair to Chewy. I'm a staff engineer on the Promotions and Virtual Bundling teams. It's been a few months now, and so far it's been a lot of fun! Even that short amount of time has been quite eventful: we've had our holiday shopping extravaganza and a fun internal hackathon. My team did quite well in both, I'm pleased to say.

One area where I really need to improve at Chewy: use of puns. At Chewy the pet-pun game is *next level*. I like to think I'm pretty good at corny joke, but these people mean business!
