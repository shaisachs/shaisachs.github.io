I started tracking book reviews on Goodreads in 2013. It was an interesting experience and on the whole I enjoyed it - the idea of seeing what my friends were reading quite agreed with me! Over the years, the platform has atrophied substantially. The API shutted quite suddenly a few years back, and not much seems to be happening there except for an occasional book giveaway. It's no secret that this property doesn't get much attention, so I decided to throw in the towel after about ten years.

I'm now [book blogging at StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/shaisachs), having published my first set of reviews today. So far I'm enjoying it! Right away one notices that the annotations available on each book are richer than on Goodreads, and the stats are more interesting as a result. I certainly hope the platform continues to improve, and I'd love to see it add an API and maybe some fun literary games in the future. Over time, I plan to move all my Goodreads reviews over to StoryGraph. For now, I'm enjoying the new digs!
