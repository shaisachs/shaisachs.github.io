I'm developing something of an unapologetic obsession with Booker Prize winners of late. I can trace that obsession back about 15 years or so, when I read [Posession](https://bookshop.org/p/books/possession-a-s-byatt/6726060?ean=9780679735908). It's such a marvelously complex, many-layered book - it would easily bear a very enjoyable second or third reading. I've since discovered that the Booker Prize list is littered with such books, like [The Sellout](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-sellout-paul-beatty/7419862?ean=9781250808240). So recently I decided for myself - why not just read through the list? Or to put it another way: life's too short to not read Bookers.

Turns out (somewhat predictably) that this philosophy is somewhat wrong-headed; the Booker committee sometimes makes mistakes, at least in my view, as they did with [Shuggie Bain](https://bookshop.org/p/books/shuggie-bain-a-novel-booker-prize-winner-douglas-stuart/18430404?ean=9780802148506), a rather unenjoyable and unimpressive work. Then there's another recent winner, [The Promise](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-promise-a-novel-booker-prize-winner-damon-galgut/15042703?ean=9781609456580), which is impressive technically but thoroughly unenjoyable in terms of reader experience. It's somewhat distressing to me that these are both recent winners - I hope the committee is not taking some kind of disastrous turn towards miserable reading.

Fortunately the story has a somewhat happy ending, or at least a happy middle, in that I've rediscovered some choice works. I just finished [The God of Small Things](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-god-of-small-things-arundhati-roy/11732546?ean=9780812979657), which was a literary masterpiece that has the same reread-it-then-reread-it-again quality that Posession had. So not all is lost! Let's hope the prize recaptures that magic with its next few winners.
