I just discovered this handy list of all the [Booker Prize winners, ranked](https://www.ontheprize.co.uk/booker-prize-winners-worst-to-best-ranked). As I wrote a little while ago, I've recently decided to [read Booker Prize winners almost exclusively]({% link 2023-07-09-booker-prize.md %}), basically because there's only so much time in the day and I've discovered that Booker Prize winners are generally really good. This list helps focus the search a little better! Thoguh I can't agree with every ranking - I can't fathom The Sellout way down at 32, or Possession at a lowly 28 - in broad strokes it looks like a helpful guide. As luck has it, I just picked up Lincoln in the Bardo recently - it's ranked #1!
