Over the past few months I've been studying spec-driven development, and today I'm publishing my sources as a NotebookLM public notebook: [Spec-Driven Development Notebook](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/62aad6c5-3fff-4edd-b7f2-3e8ea39d8d25).

Please check it out, let me know what you think - and definitely share relevant sources I've missed!

I'm really interested in sharing this material with others, hopefully in a logically-organized way. It's a kind of curriculum development, which I think is really interesting because this stuff is so new and rapidly changing. I'm no pedagogical expert by any means! Still, I gave it a shot, writing out a curriculum by hand - and then asking NotebookLM to do the same for me.

The results were... so-so. I find that NotebookLM is too eager to parrot my sources without applying any critical "thought." It's unsurprising but also sub-optimal, especially because some of my sources are a couple of months old and therefore ancient history. Even so, it did surface some interesting ideas, especially around maintaining and modifying a spec over time - obvious enough in hindsight, but I missed it in my hand-written curriculum.

As an aside, I find NotebookLM to be fascinating but also surprisingly flat-footed. Most of my sources are web links, but NotebookLM doesn't maintain the original URL for me. What's more, on the mobile app it sometimes refuses to actually import the web link I want to add - for example when I tried to add Anthropic's Claude Code Best Practices page, it pushed me to add a related Reddit thread instead. Definitely not what I wanted.

In any case it's kind of an interesting experiment in next-generation social bookmarking. I hope you find it useful!
