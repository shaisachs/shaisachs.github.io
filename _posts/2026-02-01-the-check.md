I've just wrapped up publishing my short story [The Check](https://www.amazon.com/Check-Shai-Sachs-ebook/dp/B0GKMWYFFP) on Kindle!

It's about a quirky diner where the receipts do a little more than add up your bill, with the help of a database that has a mind of its own. Customers are confused, the owner is bemused, hilarity ensues. I wouldn't say it's a rom-com exactly but I won't object if that's how you read it.

For those of you who have been following my other short stories, this one is something like the conclusion to the set of four. I've been working on this series for several years now, so it's quite satisfying to put a ribbon on it. To be clear the whole thing is self-published and is very much a just-for-fun project for me. Certainly an interesting learning experience as well.

This story was written quite heavily by ChatGPT, with a great deal of editing and pivoting on my part. That was a really strange process and honestly, I'm not sure how I feel about it! I will try and unpack that in a blog post some day. I tried to keep careful track of all of the twists and turns I took along the way, which makes for kind of an interesting change log.

In any case, if you do want to give it a go, I'd love to hear your thoughts, and I hope you enjoy it!
