I started the Boston chapter of Drinking Liberally in September 2004, and continued organizing it for ten years, stepping down in December 2014. I had some great times along the way, helping to promote quite a few progressive books (including Crashing the Gate) and hosting a few local politicos. They’re still going strong!
