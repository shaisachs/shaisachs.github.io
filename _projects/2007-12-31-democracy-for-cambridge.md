I started the Cambridge chapter of [Democracy for America](https://www.democracyforamerica.com/) shortly after the end of the Dean campaign in 2004. We worked to get our members involved in local politics, in races ranging from city council to Secretary of the Commonwealth, and to educate the community more broadly about those races. Through that work we helped to protect the Goodridge decision, and paved the way towards nationwide marriage equality.
