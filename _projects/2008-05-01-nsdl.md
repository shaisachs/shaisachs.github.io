During my time at [Isovera](https://isovera.com/), I led development for the [BiosciEdNet (BEN)](http://www.biosciednet.org/) project, which was a "pathway" of the larger NSDL project. As part of that work I also helped establish several other digital libraries in biology education which partnered with BEN. Those partner libraries in turn led to the open source [IsoveraDL](http://saas.aaas.org/isoveradl-wiki/) project. After leaving Isovera I served as an NSDL panelist, which was quite a fascinating look at the fine details of the grantmaking process.
