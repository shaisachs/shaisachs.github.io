During the late summer of 2010, I spent a good amount of time noodling around with a PDF generation library and doing some rather unholy reverse engineering of the Mercator projection. The result was PDF Turf Packets: a feature which allowed field organizers in VAN to download their turf packets rather than sending them to the printer. Sounds like a minor tweak. But by my calculation this tiny feature wound up saving Democratic campaigns over 8,000 hours of staff time... during the 2010 cycle alone!
