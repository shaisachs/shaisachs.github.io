An app which allows volunteers to earn points and badges in exchange for completing tasks to support a progressive cause or Democratic campaign. I led the team which developed this app in preparation for a ballot initiative in 2011, and subsequently expanded and generalized it for the 2012 mid-term elections. We won a series of Pollie awards for it!
