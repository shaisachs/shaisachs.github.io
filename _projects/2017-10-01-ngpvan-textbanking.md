One of my biggest projects as the Innovation Platform Director at NGP VAN was the introduction of features to support text banking. At the time this was a revolutionary new method for campaigns and organizations to contact voters and supporters, but we needed and efficient mechanism for our platform to integrate with text bank vendors like Hustle and RelayTxt (now GetThru.) I designed the API which established this two-way information exchange, and it paved the way for millions of contacts in the ensuing years.
