As the Innovation Platform Director at NGP VAN, I managed our documentation and was the primary support person for API developers. While there, I developed the "time to hello world" metric, and helped drive it down froom days to hours. I helped facilitate dozens of new integrations with the platform, notably the Mobilize events integration.  I also guided our teams in designing APIs and oversee strategy for our API.
