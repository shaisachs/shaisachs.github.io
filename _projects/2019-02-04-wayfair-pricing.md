One of the first hats I wore at Wayfair was the staff engineer for the Wayfair pricing engine. When I arrived the engine was a rather bulky, awkward, slow, and fragile thing built on dozens of stored procedures. Over time we built it into a snappy event-driven pipeline. I helped redesign the auditing piece of the pipeline, which had been one of the slowest steps in the pipeline; the redesign shaved hours off the speed of the pipeline in moving prices to site.
