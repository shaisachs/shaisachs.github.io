A short story I've been working on in the back of my head. It imagines a modern-day exchange of letters between Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing. Only in my formulation, the two are siblings trying to remember a long-lost family recipe. Naturally, the Turing test and Lady Lovelace's Objection are key themes in the background.
