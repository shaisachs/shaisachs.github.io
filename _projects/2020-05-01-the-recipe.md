A short story I wrote to explore Lady Lovelace's Objection, furthering my adventure in  [techno-magical realism through the epistolary format](https://shaisachs.com/2020/11/29/the-recipe.html). It imagines a modern-day exchange of letters between Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing. Chocolate chip cookies feature prominently, what else could you want?
