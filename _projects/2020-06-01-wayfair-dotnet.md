During my first year or so at Wayfair, I spent quite a bit of time guiding the .NET community. That included making the case for a company-wide .NET support team, adopting a proficiency quiz for code reviewers, and establishing best practices for API development. Most importantly, we developed a really lively community and had quite a bit of fun!
