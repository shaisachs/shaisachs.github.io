We've put together some pretty revolutionary new pricing tools for Wayfair partners over the course of 2020. I drove the architecture for this project and helped coordinate the service contracts for nearly a dozen different platform teams. We worked hand-in-glove with our user interface counterparts in order to deliver a vibrant, easy-to-use, beautiful new app that will serve our partners well for years to come. This architecture is just the tip of the iceberg - we've got more exciting things coming next year!
