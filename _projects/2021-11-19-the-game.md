A short story I wrote about correspondence chess, in the format of [kish≈çtenketsu](https://shaisachs.com/2021/01/09/kishotenketsu.html). Yet another piece of [techno-magical realism](https://shaisachs.com/2020/11/29/the-recipe.html). It's perhaps my most prosaic and didactic work about the limits of AI yet.
