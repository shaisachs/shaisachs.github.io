I spearheaded the effort to stand up Wayfair's enterprise API gateway in 2021 and 2022. This effort entailed two phases - first, wiring up the various components of the gateway, including its control and data planes, database, etc., and properly connecting it to our public network ingress layer. Second, and perhaps more challenging, was driving adoption of the gateway throughout the enterprise. We followed developer adoption best practices, starting with a couple of small, "simple" API projects that we could readily implement. Within six months of launching the gateway, we were able to onboard the API for Wayfair's public extranet, a major pillar of Wayfair's relationship with suppliers and other partners.
