One of my hats at Chewy is to help lead the Promotions team, responsible for calculating promotions on several billion dollars worth of revenue. I've helped to design several cutting-edge projects that will be going live soon, to sharply reduce abuse of the promotion engine, to modernize the tech stack of our engine, and to provide customers with "last-minute" opportunities to earn discounts at checkout. There's plenty more on the way, too!
