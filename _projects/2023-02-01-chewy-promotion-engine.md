One of my roles at Chewy is to help lead the Promotions team, responsible for calculating promotions on several billion dollars worth of revenue. I've helped to design several cutting-edge projects that will be going live soon, to sharply reduce abuse of the promotion engine, to modernize the tech stack of our engine, and to provide customers with "last-minute" opportunities to earn discounts at checkout. As a staff engineer, I also believe in working to "level up" my team, and I've focused on introducing Architecture Decision Records as a way to improve our documentation and decision-making. We're only just getting started!
