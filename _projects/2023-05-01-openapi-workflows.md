I've joined the committee developing the OpenAPI Workflows specification. Today the main OpenAPI specification enables API producers to document the "ingredients" of their API - that is, the resources which the API provides, and the operations available on those resources. The Workflow specification will enable API producers to document the "recipes" of their APIs as well - that is, how those resources and operations can be combined together to generate useful value for API consumers. I've contributed a couple of changes to the specification, and also established our relationship with the Cloud Native Serverless Workflows group, which is a related project.
