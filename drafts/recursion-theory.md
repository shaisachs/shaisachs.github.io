One of the most profound and elegant concepts in modern mathematics is that of the arithmetic hierarchy. It has dramatically affected the way computer scientists think about programming. What is even more interesting to me is that I think it can be a helpful tool in writing fiction, and that is an idea I've started to explore recently.

I'm not nearly enough of an expert in recursion theory to properly explain the arithmetic hierarchy, but never mind - that won't stop me from taking a stab. The idea begins with the concept of decidability. Turing famously showed that there exist some sets, and some numbers, for which it will never be possible for any algorithm to decide whether the number in question belongs to the set; these numbers are undecidable. But: suppose it were possible for some oracle to solve these decision problems for us? It turns out that, if we are equipped with such an oracle, then a new world is possible - and inside that world, there is another undecidability problem. And a second oracle, which solves the second undecidable problem, would only give rise to a third world with a third undecidable problem, and so on and so forth.

I love the idea that every oracle solves a problem at the same time that it produces a new one. Similar mechanisms are in force everywhere you look. For example: cars solve the problem of personal transport nicely, but create a variety of new problems, such as massive environmental damage.

We can also see this mechanism in force in literature. For instance, _War and Peace_ solves the problem of capturing the "zoom in" effect in literature, in which we transition quickly from a broad, sweeping view of a scene to a small, intimate view. Now we take this technique for granted and try to apply it for maximum impact.

At a less grandiose level, we can think of this mechanism operating on a chapter-by-chapter granularity within a book: each chapter solves a certain problem for the reader, by advancing the plot or depicting something important about a character, while creating a new world in which new problems must be solved: how will the hero vanquish the villain, how can we sympathize with a character who we now know to be a brute, etc. Of course, at this level the mechanism becomes almost trivial - it's just another way of saying that good writing has a logical progression, which is nothing new.

What I've been working on recently is a recursive approach to literature that falls somewhere between these two poles. In particular, what I have in mind is a series of short stories which are linked recursively. Each one solves one problem while creating a new one, and that new problem must be solved by the next story, and so forth. But there is no logical progression between these stories, in the sense that there is a standard plot which links them together. Rather, each story stands on its own, but provides a sort of platform upon which the next story stands.

To make this whole idea concrete, here is what I have in mind.
